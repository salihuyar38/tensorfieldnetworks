This repository is based on the original implementation accompanying the paper
Tensor Field Networks: Rotation- and Translation-Equivariant Neural Networks for 3D Point Clouds
.

The codebase has been updated and extended to:

Support modern Python and TensorFlow versions

Improve usability and reproducibility

Add enhanced visualization tools for better inspection of tensor features and equivariant behavior
